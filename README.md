For now, this git has the basic components to get started, you can modify it or create a branch just in case. 

To facilitate the creation of the website, a plugin for Python called **Streamlit** will be used, so I recommend that, if possible, look for tutorials on how to use it. If you think it won't work or if you know an efficient way to do it, you are free to say it on WhatsApp.

In order to run Streamlit there is a quick guide at https://streamlit.io/#install but to summarize you have to run a command **"pip install streamlit"** and run the program. Once finished, to test it you have to run the command **"streamlit run main.py"** and a page will be created and you can edit it in real time.
*To stop running in the IDE just press **Ctrl + C***
